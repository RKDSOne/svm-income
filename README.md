# svm-income
Code to generate a svm model to classify certain data to determine whether someone will make more or less than 50K>

## How to Use

1. Place '50knames.txt' and '50kadults.data' in the same directory as income.py
2. Run income.py with the argument as the file to be classified, which should be in the same format as 50kadults.data
3. Read classified file for enjoyment. Will appear as classified_ + original file name

## Some Metrics

The model should train with about 84% accuracy.

The training will take some time, around two minutes on a crappy chromebook.
